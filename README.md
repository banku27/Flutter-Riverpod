# Diving Deep into Riverpod
In this article, we will explore the various components of Riverpod, its limitations, and solutions to those limitations. We will also discuss the next big thing in the Riverpod world. So, let's get started!

# Why do we need Riverpod?
There are certain problems with Provider that cannot be fixed, such as confusing syntax, multiple providers not having the same return data type, and the infamous "Provider not found" exception. To overcome these problems, Riverpod was introduced. It not only serves as a state management solution but also replaces design patterns like singletons, dependency injection, and service locators. It also helps in fetching, caching, and canceling network requests while handling error cases.

1. Provider
Provider is an object that provides data to widgets or other providers. It is a read-only widget and cannot update the value inside it. It can be used to provide primitive and non-primitive data types, as well as instances of classes.
To create a Provider, define a final variable with the desired type and assign it a value using a function. For example:

final nameProvider = Provider<String>((ref) => 'Pankaj');
To access the value provided by the nameProvider, you can use the Consumer widget or the ref.watch() method. For example:
final name = ref.watch(nameProvider); //Now you can use the value of name in your widget.
